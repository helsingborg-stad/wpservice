    /**
 * Returns an array containing the current upload directory's path and URL.
 *
 * Checks the 'upload_path' option, which should be from the web root folder,
 * and if it isn't empty it will be used. If it is empty, then the path will be
 * 'WP_CONTENT_DIR/uploads'. If the 'UPLOADS' constant is defined, then it will
 * override the 'upload_path' option and 'WP_CONTENT_DIR/uploads' path.
 *
 * The upload URL path is set either by the 'upload_url_path' option or by using
 * the 'WP_CONTENT_URL' constant and appending '/uploads' to the path.
 *
 * If the 'uploads_use_yearmonth_folders' is set to true (checkbox if checked in
 * the administration settings panel), then the time will be used. The format
 * will be year first and then month.
 *
 * If the path couldn't be created, then an error will be returned with the key
 * 'error' containing the error message. The error suggests that the parent
 * directory is not writable by the server.
