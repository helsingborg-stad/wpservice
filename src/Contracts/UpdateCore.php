    /**
 * Upgrades the core of WordPress.
 *
 * This will create a .maintenance file at the base of the WordPress directory
 * to ensure that people can not access the website, when the files are being
 * copied to their locations.
 *
 * The files in the `$_old_files` list will be removed and the new files
 * copied from the zip file after the database is upgraded.
 *
 * The files in the `$_new_bundled_files` list will be added to the installation
 * if the version is greater than or equal to the old version being upgraded.
 *
 * The steps for the upgrader for after the new release is downloaded and
 * unzipped is:
 *   1. Test unzipped location for select files to ensure that unzipped worked.
 *   2. Create the .maintenance file in current WordPress base.
 *   3. Copy new WordPress directory over old WordPress files.
 *   4. Upgrade WordPress to new version.
 *     4.1. Copy all files/folders other than wp-content
 *     4.2. Copy any language files to WP_LANG_DIR (which may differ from WP_CONTENT_DIR
 *     4.3. Copy any new bundled themes/plugins to their respective locations
 *   5. Delete new WordPress directory path.
 *   6. Delete .maintenance file.
 *   7. Remove old files.
 *   8. Delete 'update_core' option.
 *
 * There are several areas of failure. For instance if PHP times out before step
 * 6, then you will not be able to access any portion of your site. Also, since
 * the upgrade will not continue where it left off, you will not be able to
 * automatically remove old files and remove the 'update_core' option. This
 * isn't that bad.
 *
 * If the copy of the new WordPress over the old fails, then the worse is that
 * the new WordPress directory will remain.
 *
 * If it is assumed that every file will be copied over, including plugins and
 * themes, then if you edit the default theme, you should rename it, so that
 * your changes remain.
