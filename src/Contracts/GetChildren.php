{
    /**
 * Retrieves all children of the post parent ID.
 *
 * Normally, without any enhancements, the children would apply to pages. In the
 * context of the inner workings of WordPress, pages, posts, and attachments
 * share the same table, so therefore the functionality could apply to any one
 * of them. It is then noted that while this function does not work on posts, it
 * does not mean that it won't work on posts. It is recommended that you know
 * what context you wish to retrieve the children of.
 *
 * Attachments may also be made the child of a post, so if that is an accurate
 * statement (which needs to be verified), it would then be possible to get
 * all of the attachments for a post. Attachments have since changed since
 * version 2.5, so this is most likely inaccurate, but serves generally as an
 * example of what is possible.
 *
 * The arguments listed as defaults are for this function and also of the
 * get_posts() function. The arguments are combined with the get_children defaults
 * and are then passed to the get_posts() function, which accepts additional arguments.
 * You can replace the defaults in this function, listed below and the additional
 * arguments listed in the get_posts() function.
 *
 * The 'post_parent' is the most important argument and important attention
 * needs to be paid to the $args parameter. If you pass either an object or an
 * integer (number), then just the 'post_parent' is grabbed and everything else
 * is lost. If you don't specify any arguments, then it is assumed that you are
 * in The Loop and the post parent will be grabbed for from the current post.
 *
 * The 'post_parent' argument is the ID to get the children. The 'numberposts'
 * is the amount of posts to retrieve that has a default of '-1', which is
 * used to get all of the posts. Giving a number higher than 0 will only
 * retrieve that amount of posts.
 *
 * The 'post_type' and 'post_status' arguments can be used to choose what
 * criteria of posts to retrieve. The 'post_type' can be anything, but WordPress
 * post types are 'post', 'pages', and 'attachments'. The 'post_status'
 * argument will accept any post status within the write administration panels.
 *
 * @since 2.0.0
 *
 * @see get_posts()
 * @todo Check validity of description.
 *
 * @global WP_Post $post Global post object.
 *
 * @param mixed $args   Optional. User defined arguments for replacing the defaults. Default empty.
 * @param string $output Optional. The required return type. One of OBJECT, ARRAY_A, or ARRAY_N, which
 *                       correspond to a WP_Post object, an associative array, or a numeric array,
 *                       respectively. Default OBJECT.
 * @return WP_Post[]|array[]|int[] Array of post objects, arrays, or IDs, depending on `$output`.
