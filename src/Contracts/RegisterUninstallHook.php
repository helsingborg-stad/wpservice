 * Sets the uninstallation hook for a plugin.

 * Registers the uninstall hook that will be called when the user clicks on the
 * uninstall link that calls for the plugin to uninstall itself. The link won't
 * be active unless the plugin hooks into the action.
 *
 * The plugin should not run arbitrary code outside of functions, when
 * registering the uninstall hook. In order to run using the hook, the plugin
 * will have to be included, which means that any code laying outside of a
 * function will be run during the uninstallation process. The plugin should not
 * hinder the uninstallation process.
 *
 * If the plugin can not be written without running code within the plugin, then
 * the plugin should create a file named 'uninstall.php' in the base plugin
 * folder. This file will be called, if it exists, during the uninstallation process
 * bypassing the uninstall hook. The plugin, when using the 'uninstall.php'
 * should always check for the 'WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN' constant, before
 * executing.
